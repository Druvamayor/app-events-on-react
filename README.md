## Example of onChange event and onClick event in React and their concepts
In React, the onChange and onClick events are two common event handlers used to handle user interactions in web applications. Here's a brief description of each:

onChange Event:
The onChange event is typically used with form elements like input fields, select boxes, and textareas.
It triggers when the value of the element changes, typically as a result of user input.
For example, when a user types text into an input field or selects an option from a dropdown menu, the onChange event is fired.
Developers often use this event to capture user input and update the state or data in a React component, allowing for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
